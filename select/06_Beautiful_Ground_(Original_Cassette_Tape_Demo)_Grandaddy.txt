You said I'd wake up dead drunk
Alone in the park
I called you a liar
But how right you were
Walk to the bank
Shakes from the night before
Stare at the tiki floor
High school
Marriage rings
Keys under the mats
All of the houses here
Not the motels
I tried to sing it funny like Beck
But it's bringing me down
Lower than ground
Beautiful ground
Tried to sing it funny like Beck
But it's bringing me down
Lower than ground
Beautiful ground
Beautiful ground
Beautiful ground
Beautiful ground
Beautiful ground
There's a plenty of birds
And rocks and things
